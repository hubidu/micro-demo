zeit micro demo repository
==========================

https://github.com/zeit/micro
https://github.com/amio/awesome-micro

## PROs

- Simple: "Everything is a function"
- Composable
- Better testability
- Lightweight (claims to be, but IMHO also feels more lightweight compared to express)
- No callbacks (like in express middleware)
- "Poor man's lambda functions"
- Interesting idea: Use the file system as router https://github.com/jesseditson/fs-router

## CONs

- Not all the plugins might work together seamlessly
- Not so much different from express, koa...
